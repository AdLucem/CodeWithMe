Learning to code with a bunch of friends

- Milestone 0

Open a python interpreter! Google colab works. 

- Milestone 1

Write a few lines of python code with both an assignment, an equality and some math.

An assignment operator is `=` . An equality operator is `==`. What does each do? (Hint: this `=` is not the same as 
a math `=` )

- Milestone 2

Python has basic operators: `+` `-` `*` `/` `%` `=` `==` `//` `**`
Python has basic types: `string`, `int`, `float`, `boolean`
For each operator: what types does it work on, what result does it give for every type-combination, and what type combinations is it invalid for? We basically want to make a list like this:

* `-` : int `-` int -> int : subtracts integers
* `-` : string `-` string -> INVALID 
* `-` : int - float -> float : treats both the int and float as float, and subtracts them
* `+` : string `+` string -> string : joins both strings
* `+` : int `+` int -> int : adds both integers

and so on for all the basic operators and type combinations.
